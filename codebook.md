# Sumarry
Each row in the final dataset represents one combination of subject and activity.

The first two columns indicate which subject is performing the tests and which activity is being performed. The remaining columns represent the mean of the measured values for each feature for a particular subject and activity.

For detailed information on how the raw data was collected refer to the UCI Machine Learning Repository linked in `README.md`.
